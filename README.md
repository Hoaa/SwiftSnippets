# SwiftSnippets

**How to import all code snippets to Xcode**
--------
All Xcode code snippets exist as a .plist files in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/ You can simply copy all code snippets from plist directory in this repo into this folder, and then you should restart Xcode to use those.

Note: Create the folder if CodeSnippets folder doesn't exist already. It is created by Xcode when user adds their first custom snippet.
